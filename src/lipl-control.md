# Lipl Control

If the device the application is running on has an Internet Connection, the application can synchronize its data with Lipl Storage. Synchronization is important so the application can also be used when there is no Internet Connection.

On Android the application can establish a connection with Lipl Display. Lipl Display uses advertising so the device can be found.
If the connection is established, you can use the play button to display parts of a lyric or playlist.

Flutter can also build a web app. This can be handy for people maintaining the data. Bluetooth connection are not possible though.
